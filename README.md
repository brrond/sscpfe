Super Simple Command Prompt File Editor (sscpfe)

<h2>Why?</h2>
Recently I used linux a lot. There are a lot of text console-based editors (vim, nano, etc.).
Later I used Windows again and... you know... notepad.
So I decided to create some sort of nano (my favorite console text editor) editor for Windows.

<h2>Why C#?</h2>
Firstly, there are a lot editors for linux and no editors (joke) for Windows. This one is exclusive.<br>
Secondly, why the hell did I learned C# in university?
